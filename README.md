Firstly, data preprocessing steps were performed by reading the data from the CSV file 'odev_tenis.csv,' where weather information and humidity predictions based on certain conditions are considered. These steps include converting categorical data into numerical format and applying one-hot encoding. Subsequently, training and test datasets were created, and a linear regression model was used to fit the training data. The model's performance was then evaluated on the test data. Statistical analysis was employed to summarize the model, and unnecessary variables were removed through the backward elimination method to enhance the model. The results were visualized by comparing the model's predictions with the actual values.
